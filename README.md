1. You should have installed Visual Studio 2017 (or higher version with Fortran compiler) and Paraview v5 (or "GiD" v15).
2. Change the path: C:\Users\pimen\Documents\Visual Studio 2017\VORTONEX_v1...to yours in VortoNeX.f90 and vortonex_state.pvsm files.
3. Open VortoNeX.vfproj
4. Go to input.txt (optional to change parameters).
5. Press "start" to run the code (and wait for it to finish).
6. To visualize the results load the "State" in Paraview (in GiD and open/drag the .msh file in the postprocessor mode).
